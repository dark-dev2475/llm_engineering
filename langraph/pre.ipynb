      "Summary: Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a family of large language models (LLMs) released by Meta AI starting in February 2023. The latest version is Llama 4, released in April 2025.\n",
      "Llama models come in different sizes, ranging from 1 billion to 2 trillion parameters. Initially only a foundation model, starting with Llama 2, Meta AI released instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.\n",
      "Model weights for the first version of Llama were only available to researchers on a case-by-case basis, under a non-commercial license. Unauthorized copies of the first model were shared via BitTorrent. Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use.\n",
      "Alongside the release of Llama 3, Meta added virtual assistant features to Facebook and WhatsApp in select regions, and a standalone website. Both services use a Llama 3 model.\n",

      "Page: Llama\n",
      "Summary: The llama (; Spanish pronunciation: [ˈʎama] or [ˈʝama]) (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the pre-Columbian era.\n",
      "Llamas are social animals and live with others as a herd. Their wool is soft and contains only a small amount of lanolin. Llamas can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km (5–8 miles). The name llama (also historically spelled \"lama\" or \"glama\") was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians.\n",
      "The ancestors of llamas are thought to have originated on the Great Plains of North America about 40 million years ago and subsequently migrated to South America about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange. By the end of the last ice age (10,000–12,000 years ago), camelids were extinct in North America. As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in South America. Some were imported to the United States and Canada late in the 20th century; their descendants now number more than 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas.\n",
      "In Aymara mythology, llamas are important beings. The Heavenly Llama is said to drink water from the ocean and urinates as it rains. According to Aymara eschatology, llamas will return to the water springs and ponds where they come from at the end of time.\n",

      "Page: Generative artificial intelligence\n",
      "Summary: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI, or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data. These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts.\n",
      "Generative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video models such as Veo, LTXV and Sora. Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta AI, Microsoft, Google, DeepSeek, and Baidu.\n",
      "Generative AI has raised many ethical questions and governance challenges as it can be used for cybercrime, or to deceive or manipulate people through fake news or deepfakes. Even if used ethically, it may lead to mass replacement of human jobs. The tools themselves have been criticized as violating intellectual property laws, since they are trained on copyrighted works.\n",
      "Generative AI is used across many industries. Examples include software development, healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service, sales and marketing, art, writing, fashion, and product design.\u001b[0m\n",

    "ReAct Agent (Reasoning + Acting):\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting in a single loop to handle tasks. The agent uses natural language reasoning (thinking through steps) and task actions (performing tasks like calculations or data retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent uses a combination of reasoning steps to guide actions in real-time, using feedback from those actions to further inform the next step in reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: The agent receives a question or task.\n",
    "Step 2: It reasons aloud (in natural language) about how to solve it.\n",
    "Step 3: Based on its reasoning, it takes actions (e.g., searching a database, calculating something).\n",
    "Step 4: The results of these actions are integrated into its reasoning and may trigger further actions.\n",
    "Step 5: It repeats the process until it arrives at a solution.\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Combines thinking and doing (reasoning and actions).\n",
    "Performs iterative steps, updating its process based on action results.\n",
    "Typically handles complex decision-making scenarios.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original task: “Calculate the total number of apples in a basket if there are 4 baskets and 7 apples in each.”\n",
    "Reasoning: \"I need to multiply 4 by 7 to get the total number of apples.\"\n",
    "Action: Perform the multiplication.\n",
